# ToneXP | Retro Gaming Platform

ToneXP is a retro gaming platform built with **Next.js** and **Prisma**, designed to bring classic games to the web. The platform is <em>somewhat</em> desktop-friendly and features a variety of emulator systems, including **Arcade**, **Atari**, **Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)**, **Nintendo 64**, **PlayStation**, **Mega Drive**, and more. Itâ€™s a work in progress, so feel free to contribute!

The project allows you to run it locally or move your assets to an **AWS S3 bucket** for hosting. Please note that **game ROMs are not included**.

    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-website-here/*"
        }
    ]
}
```
